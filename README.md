# MochaMap
Your coffee shop
This project was created in collaboration with Luiz and Victor Lino. I was primarily responsible for the front end, but we all worked together as a team on the development of this coffee shop sampling application for Vancouver. In the app, users can rank their favorite cafes, which can be evaluated and searched. I developed all the visual elements, and the project includes a database implementation, as well as login/logout pages, a home page, and a map.
